Seq_Help[] = R"seqhelp(
PretextSnapshot, sequence specification string format.

Nomenclature:
      Texel: 	    A single image unit of the underlying pretext map.
      Pixel:	    A single image unit of the output image(s).
      x-dimension:  The horizontal dimension of the contact maps and output images.
		    Runs from left-to-right (zero on the left-hand edge). 
      y-dimension:  The vertical dimension of the contact maps and output images.
		    Runs from top-to-bottom (zero on the top edge).

A comma separated list of entries. Each entry, except for "=all", corresponds with one output image.
"<entry> [, <entry>]*" in regex notation.


Each <entry> is either:
	one of the two strings "=full" or "=all"
	a <range>
	or a pair of comma separated <range>s enclosed in curly-brackets, { <range>, <range> }

"=full": specifies the whole contact map.

"=all": creates an image of each sequence in the contact map.

A single <range> specifies a single range of coordinates.
These coordinates are taken over both the x and y dimensions of the contact map,
resulting in a symmetric, square image, centred on the main diagonal.

A pair of <range>s specifies a pair of coordinate ranges over the x and y dimensions respectively,
{ <range>-x, <range-y>}. The resulting image can therefore be of any region of the contact map.


Each <range> is a <startCoord> with a conditionally optional <endCoord>,
separated by a ">".
"<startCoord> [\> <endCoord>]?" in regex notation.

Each <startCoord> and <endCoord> is a <name> with an optional <bpCoord>
enclosed in square-brackets.
"<name> [ \[<bpCoord>\] ]?" in regex notation.

Each <name> is the name of a sequence in the contact map.
Each <bpCoord> is a non-negative integer, specifying a base-pair coordinate,
relative to the corresponding sequence.

If a <bpCoord> is not specified, the coordinate is taken as 0 in the case of a <startCoord>
and the length of the sequence in the case of an <endCoord>.

Additionally, if a <bpCoord> is not specified in a <startCoord>, the <endCoord> of the <range>
can be omitted, and is taken as the same sequence as the <startCoord>.

Within a <range>, <startCoord> must be less than <endCoord>.
Meaning that <name> in <startCoord> must either:
	Occur before the <name> in <endCoord> in the map,
	Or be the same as the <name> in <endCoord> and the <bpCoord> of <startCoord>
        must be less than the <bpCoord> of <endCoord>.


Note that all <bpCoord> values will be taken to the nearest appropriate texel,
based on the base-pair resolution of the map.

Note that all images are subject to the minTexel constraint,
including all the sequence images implied by "=all".

The sequence string is insensitive to white-space.


Examples: 

	--sequences "=full"

	Creates a single image of the full contact map.


	--sequences "=full, =all"

	Creates an image of the full contact map, plus an image of each sequence.


	--sequences "seq_0"

	Creates a single image of the sequence named "seq_0"


	--sequences "seq_0, seq_1 > seq_2"

	Creates an image of seq_0, and an image from the start of seq_1 to the end of seq_2


	--sequences "seq_0[1000000] > seq_3"

	Creates an image starting 1Mbp into seq_0, ending at the end of seq_3


	--sequences "{seq_0, seq_1}"

	Create an single image of the off-diagonal region between seq_0 and seq_1,
        i.e. the inter-sequence map of seq_0 and seq_1.


	--sequences "{seq_2[2000000] > seq_4[1000000] , seq_0[3000000] > seq_1[4000000]} , seq_0 > seq_10"

	Creates two images. The first is the off-diagonal region between 2Mbp into seq_2 and 1Mbp
        into seq_4 along the x-dimension, and 3Mbp into seq_0 and 4Mbp into seq_1 along the y-dimension.
	The second image is the diagonal region between the start of seq_0 and the end of seq_10.
